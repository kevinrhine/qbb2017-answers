For three of my top 5 hits, snpEff could not find a matching chromosome, so it is difficult to evaluate where those SNPs would be located and how they would affect the organism, if at all.

Both of the other two top hits are in regions of the yeast genome that are believed to be non-coding. Specifically, they are adjacent to the yeast 25S rRNA gene. Often, these regions are used in metagenomic sequence identification because they tend to have high sequence variability from species-to-species. It stands to reason that individuals within a population would also have high sequence variability, even if there is no putative effect on the organism.
