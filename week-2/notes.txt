Sequencing Machines

- Hiseq 4
- PacBio Sequel single molecule real time sequencer
	- tethers DNA to bottom well, monitors DNA synthesis by fluor label release
- Oxford nanopore (handheld sequencer)
	- DNA fed through pore that uses electrochemical signaling to monitor base addition
	- 50 - 100 kb max
- Illumina
	- 100 - 400 bp usually

Shotgun Sequencing

- String problem
	- All fragments are parts of the original string (i.e. DNA molecule)
	- There are infinitely many possible superstring (a string that contains every read as a substring)
	- Which superstring do we want?
	- First, the shortest possible length
	
- Graph problem
	- Hamiltonian Cycle: Visit each vertex (node) once
		- Difficult to accomplish 
	- Konigsberg bridge problem
		- Cross each edge once
		- Path must have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree
		- Shortest path that visits each vertex exactly once
		- No efficient solution -- takes too much time because it requires exponential functions
		- Doesn't allow for errors
	- Strategy
		- Overlap-layout-consensus
		- Overlap: find potentially overlapping reads
		- Layout: order the reads
		- How can we find high scoring non-exact matches?
		- Find best match between a suffix of a read at prefix and suffix
	- Problem: strategy is a greedy algorithm
		- Start with where are the best matching reads?
		- Problem: Makes trees or branches
	- Updated strategy: sort edges by weight, only add if it doesn't branch
